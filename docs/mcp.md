# Stage as an MCP server

`stage mcp` speaks the Model Context Protocol over stdio. Any MCP client
can start it; the command is the same everywhere:

```
node /path/to/stage/bin/stage.js mcp
```

Replace `/path/to/stage` with where you cloned it. Once the package is on
npm, `npx -y stage-engine mcp` does the same without a clone.

## Clients

**Claude Code**

```sh
claude mcp add --scope user stage -- node /path/to/stage/bin/stage.js mcp
```

A project can also carry it: this repository's `.mcp.json` starts the server
from the checkout when you open it in Claude Code.

**Codex**

```sh
codex mcp add stage -- node /path/to/stage/bin/stage.js mcp
```

or in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.stage]
command = "node"
args = ["/path/to/stage/bin/stage.js", "mcp"]
```

**Claude Desktop** (`claude_desktop_config.json`), **Cursor**
(`.cursor/mcp.json` or the global one), **Gemini CLI**
(`~/.gemini/settings.json`), and most other clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stage": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/stage/bin/stage.js", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** (`.vscode/mcp.json`) uses `servers` instead of `mcpServers`,
with the same `command` and `args`.

Renders need Chromium or Chrome on the machine; set `STAGE_CHROMIUM` to its
path if it is somewhere unusual.

**Model search keys.** `find_model` searches Poly Haven, Sketchfab and the
Icosa Gallery with no key. Two more things need free keys in the server's
environment: `POLY_PIZZA_KEY` (an app key from poly.pizza/settings/api)
turns on Poly Pizza, and `SKETCHFAB_TOKEN` (your API token from
sketchfab.com/settings/password) lets Sketchfab models be downloaded, not
just found. In a JSON config they go in `env`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stage": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/stage/bin/stage.js", "mcp"],
      "env": { "POLY_PIZZA_KEY": "...", "SKETCHFAB_TOKEN": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

With Claude Code: `claude mcp add --scope user -e POLY_PIZZA_KEY=... -e SKETCHFAB_TOKEN=... stage -- node /path/to/stage/bin/stage.js mcp`.

## What the server exposes

**Instructions.** The agent guide (`src/skill.md`) is sent as the server's
instructions at startup, so a client that shows them to the model knows
the scene format, free objects and assemblies, how several floors work,
and the order of work (rooms, then openings, then furniture, or a group
and its parts, rendering and looking after each step)
before its first call. Clients that ignore instructions still get the
guide from the `stage://guide` resource, and `stage skill install` puts it
where Claude Code and Codex read skills.

**Tools.** Each one says what it is for and what to call next; `set` carries
an example entity for every collection, `query` lists its questions, and
`assets` lists its categories.

| Tool | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `new_scene` | Start a scene, empty or from an example |
| `open_viewer` | Open it in the person's browser; the page follows the file |
| `show` | Point their view at a camera, a level, or an entity |
| `check` | Schema, references, and spatial rules, each with its fix |
| `render` | An image of any camera, `room:<id>`, `plan:<level>`, or a contact sheet |
| `query` | Rooms, a room's edges and neighbors, objects and where they ended up, what fits where, free space, areas |
| `set`, `remove`, `write_scene` | Change the file; every write is checked and reported |
| `read_scene` | The whole file, when query is not enough |
| `assets`, `fetch_assets`, `materials` | The library, downloading what a scene needs, the surfaces |
| `find_model`, `fetch_model` | Search the open model libraries with thumbnails; fetch one beside the scene and place it |
| `schema` | The format as JSON Schema, whole or per collection |
| `export` | The built scene as binary glTF |

**Resources.** `stage://guide` (the guide), `stage://schema` (the format),
and `stage://examples/<name>` for `flat`, `flat-with-bedroom`, `two-storey`,
and `desk` (no rooms: free objects with parents).

**Prompts.** `from-floor-plan` (a plan image and a path in, a walkable home
out) and `furnish` (one room, laid out with pieces that fit).

## What an agent sees

Writes land in the file the person's browser is watching, so the page
updates the moment a tool returns and outlines what changed. `render`
returns the PNG in the tool result, so the model looks at it in the same
turn. `check` and `query` answer in words that name entities and fixes,
which is what lets a model that has never seen Stage fix its own mistakes.
